# Kth-To-Nth-Most-Common-Word
Project from a course in Algorithms and Data Structures

Assignment was as follows: "Implement a program which takes as input a text file and allows the user to (repeatedly without re-reading the input file) ask questions: 
i) Which is the k:th most common word, 
ii) Which are the k:th to the k+n:th most common words. 
Use https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/data/leipzig/leipzig1m.txt  as input. The questions should be answered in constant time (assume k and n << N)."

To save time, this assignment allowed us to borrow code from Algoritms by Sedgewick & Wayne. Because of this, the BinarySearchST, BST, Stack, and Node implementations are all greatly borrowed from Sedgewick & Wayne.
